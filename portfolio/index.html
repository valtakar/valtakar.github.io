    <h1>Kasper Valtakari's portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a software developer from Finland. 
        I'm teacher in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. 
        I'm interested in web development, mobile development and game development.
        I'm also interested in artificial intelligence.
        I'm always looking for new projects to work on.
        If you have a project that you would like me to work on,
        please contact me.</p>
